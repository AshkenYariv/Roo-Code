# Roo-Code Deployment & Frontend Integration Roadmap

## Project Overview

This roadmap outlines the complete strategy for deploying Roo-Code as a standalone service and building a comprehensive frontend that leverages all of Roo-Code's capabilities through APIs.

## Current State Analysis

Roo-Code is currently a VS Code extension with:
- ✅ Robust API layer (`src/extension/api.ts`)
- ✅ IPC communication system
- ✅ 20+ tools for file operations, terminal, browser automation
- ✅ Multi-provider AI integration
- ✅ Task management with sub-tasks
- ✅ Example API server (`examples/api-server.ts`)
- ✅ MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- ✅ Custom modes and instructions

## Feasibility Assessment

**✅ HIGHLY FEASIBLE** - The project has excellent foundations:

1. **Existing API Infrastructure**: Well-structured API layer with IPC support
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between core engine and VS Code integration
3. **Tool System**: Comprehensive set of tools already abstracted
4. **Configuration Management**: Robust settings and profile management
5. **Example Implementation**: Working API server example exists

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Extract Core Engine (Weeks 1-2)
Extract Roo-Code's core functionality from VS Code dependencies into a standalone service.

### Phase 2: API Service Development (Weeks 3-4)
Build production-ready API service with authentication, workspace management, and real-time communication.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 5-8)
Create modern React/Next.js frontend with complete API coverage and real-time updates.

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Weeks 9-10)
Implement comprehensive testing strategy and production deployment pipeline.

### Phase 5: Production Hardening (Weeks 11-12)
Security, monitoring, scaling, and optimization.

## Success Metrics

- **API Coverage**: 100% of Roo-Code tools accessible via API
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms API response times for synchronous operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
- **Scalability**: Support for concurrent users and workspaces
- **Security**: Proper authentication, authorization, and sandboxing
- **User Experience**: Intuitive frontend matching VS Code extension capabilities

2. **Set Up Development**: Follow [Phase 1 setup guide](./01-core-extraction/README.md)
3. **API Development**: Proceed to [API service development](./02-api-service/README.md)
4. **Frontend Development**: Build UI with [frontend guide](./03-frontend/README.md)
5. **Testing**: Implement [testing strategy](./04-testing/README.md)
6. **Deploy**: Follow [deployment pipeline](./05-deployment/README.md)

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | Weeks 1-2 | Core engine extraction, standalone service |
| 2 | Weeks 3-4 | Production API, authentication, WebSocket |
| 3 | Weeks 5-8 | Frontend app, real-time UI, tool coverage |
