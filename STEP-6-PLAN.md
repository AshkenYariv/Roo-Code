# Step 1.6: Validation and Testing (Days 9-10)

## 🎯 Objective
Comprehensive validation that all extracted functionality works correctly, with complete test coverage, performance benchmarks, and integration testing to ensure production readiness.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing functionality working without VS Code
- [ ] API tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Integration tests with example scripts
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved

## 🔧 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Day 9 Morning)
```bash
# Component-level testing
npm run test:unit:engine     # TaskManager, Task, RooEngine
npm run test:unit:tools      # All tool implementations
npm run test:unit:api        # API endpoints and middleware
npm run test:unit:providers  # AI provider integrations
```

### Integration Testing (Day 9 Afternoon)
```bash
# End-to-end workflow testing
npm run test:integration:task-execution
npm run test:integration:tool-workflows
npm run test:integration:api-workflows
npm run test:integration:websocket
```

### Performance Testing (Day 10 Morning)
```bash
# Benchmark against original VS Code extension
npm run benchmark:task-execution
npm run benchmark:tool-performance
npm run benchmark:api-response-times
npm run benchmark:memory-usage
```

### Compatibility Testing (Day 10 Afternoon)
```bash
# Validate with existing examples
npm run test:compatibility:api-server
npm run test:compatibility:original-examples
npm run test:backwards-compatibility
```

- [ ] ✅ Configuration management
- [ ] ✅ Error handling and logging
- [ ] ✅ Event system working correctly

### API Functionality  
- [ ] ✅ All REST endpoints working
- [ ] ✅ WebSocket communication
- [ ] ✅ Request validation
- [ ] ✅ Error responses
- [ ] ✅ Rate limiting basics
- [ ] ✅ CORS handling

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] ✅ Unit test coverage > 90%
- [ ] ✅ Integration tests covering main workflows
- [ ] ✅ Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] ✅ Memory leak detection
- [ ] ✅ Error scenario testing
- [ ] ✅ Load testing under realistic conditions

### Documentation
- [ ] ✅ API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] ✅ Usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] ✅ Migration guide from VS Code extension
- [ ] ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] ✅ Performance benchmarks documented

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Task Execution**: < 2x overhead vs original
- **API Response**: < 100ms for synchronous operations
- **Memory Usage**: < 150% of original extension
- **Tool Execution**: < 10% performance degradation

### Quality Targets
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% line coverage
- **API Uptime**: 99.9% during testing period
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% for valid requests
- **Documentation**: 100% API coverage

## 🚨 Risk Validation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Tool Security**: Validate sandboxing works correctly
2. **File Operations**: Test path traversal protection
3. **Terminal Execution**: Verify command injection prevention
4. **Memory Leaks**: Long-running server stability
5. **Concurrent Tasks**: Race condition testing

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Security testing
npm run test:security:file-sandbox
npm run test:security:command-injection
npm run test:security:path-traversal

# Stability testing
npm run test:stability:long-running
npm run test:stability:memory-leaks
npm run test:stability:concurrent-tasks
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Baseline Measurements
```bash
# Establish performance baselines
npm run benchmark:baseline

# Compare with VS Code extension
npm run benchmark:compare-vscode

# API performance under load
npm run benchmark:api-load
```

### Expected Results
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Task Creation | < 50ms | TBD |
| Tool Execution | < 200ms | TBD |
| API Response | < 100ms | TBD |
| Memory Usage | < 500MB | TBD |

## 🔄 Continuous Validation

### Automated Testing Pipeline
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks
npm run test:pre-commit

# CI/CD validation
npm run test:ci

# Regression testing
npm run test:regression
```

## 📁 Deliverables

### Required Outputs
1. ✅ Complete test suite (90%+ coverage)
2. ✅ Performance benchmark report
3. ✅ Integration test results
4. ✅ Security validation report
5. ✅ API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
6. ✅ Migration guide from VS Code
7. ✅ Troubleshooting documentation

### Final Validation
```bash
# Complete validation suite
npm run validate:all

# Production readiness check
npm run validate:production

# Final sign-off
npm run validate:phase1-complete
```

## 🎯 Phase 1 Success Criteria

At the end of Step 1.6, we should have:
- ✅ **Standalone Roo-Code engine** running independently
- ✅ **Basic HTTP API** with all core endpoints
- ✅ **All tools functional** without VS Code dependencies
- ✅ **Validation tests passing** with high coverage
- ✅ **Performance benchmarks** meeting targets
- ✅ **Documentation complete** for Phase 2 transition

## ➡️ Phase 2 Preparation
